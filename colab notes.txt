colab notes

- Colab runs on Linux Box (which has its own files & RAM)

=> anything with ! means run on system terminal

=> download data directly to the box & use it (instead from Google Drive)
   \
    -> ! wget {url}    // web get

=> unzip any tar file  :- ! unzip {file.gz}

   Unzip tar gz file -> shutil   // shell util
     ;- shutul.unpack_archive()

     ! gunzip {zip_file}   // unzip gz files


Linux Command

   ! head -100 {file}   // top 100 lines


* To mount the Google Drive With Google Colab :
  ----
   -> ie you are putting some window of Google Drive to Google Colab Machine where its being hosted

   -> To reflect changes done in Google Drive Space on Google Colab -> to actual Google Drive :-
        \
         -> drive.flush_and_unmount()
