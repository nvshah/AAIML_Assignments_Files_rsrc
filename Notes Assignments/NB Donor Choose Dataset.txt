Q) Why THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN EACH OF THE VECTOR WONT BE SAME ??
   in CountVectorizer of Text ??

-------------

Preprocessing is done already by the AAIC team & we get Pre-Processed Data


Features :-
-------
-> Categorical Data :- One hot Encoding
   Numerical Data :- Scaling
   Text :- bow | TFIDF


* For sub-categories : (text data)
        \
        1) first we clean the text format ie
        2) then we also count the count for each individual words


* project_grade_counts :- (Enum)


* Text Features :
  ------
   - first apply some Decontraction (ie some manual replacement)


* To get the likelihoods calculated by Model :
  -----
   use feature_log_prob_  param on fitted classifier

smoothening :- {10, 100, 1000, 5000}


steps :- (Aafter Pre-Processed)

1) Vectorize the Categorical & Numerical Features
