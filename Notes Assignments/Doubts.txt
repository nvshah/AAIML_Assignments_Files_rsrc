Doubts

Q) When we do CountVectorizer() ?
   - We do fit only on train & then transform both test & train 

   But when we do Scaling do we need to do it on train or entire feature ie train + test ??


Q) How MultiNomial NB handles the Integral Counts ie (Tf-IDF or likewise)
   
   - as it requires the discrete values (multiple nomial values)

Q) In MultiNomial NB Feature Encoding
   ----
    If feature is Categorical but it has string as category value
    Eg gender :- 'male', 'Female'

    & 
    If feature is Numerical & it has discrete values 
    Eg Ratings :- [1,2,3,4,5]

    Then do we need to perform encoding for this both features ?? 
    or 
    Or for any one of them
    or 
    neither encoding is needed ??


 Q) In MultiNomial NB, if there are total 5 Features
 
    out of which 4 are categorical & 1 is Numerical(not discrete)
    Then does MultiNomial NB do care of that Numerical Feature internally as Non-Discrete Feature
    do not have Probability so need to compute either bins or PDF !

 Q) hyper-Param Selection
